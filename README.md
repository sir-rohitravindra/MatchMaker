# MatchMaker

## My take on making a Tinder Clone

Hosted the fronted on : <b>Firebase</b>
Hosted the backend on : <b>Heroku</b>

Hosting URL: https://matchmaker-2c5d1.web.app

`npm start`
    Starts the development server.

  `npm run build`
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  `npm test`
    Starts the test runner.

  `npm run eject`
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  `cd match-maker`
  `npm start`

<b>Happy hacking!</b>
